SwiftUI Animations and other resources from Shubham Singh
Hey, SwiftUI coders.

I have some links I would like to share from a friend of mine, Shubham Singh.

He authored four animations in this course and is a very talented SwiftUI programmer:

Project 17 - Be Fruitful and Multiply

Project 18 - Lighten Up - Light Switch

Project 19 - Lets Connect - WiFi Loading Animation

Project 20 - Never judge a book by its movie - Book Loader
